Introduction: For this assignment, you must train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on a furnished pre-labeled corpus, and then use the Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely part-of-speech (POS) tags for all the tokens in a separate test document. The corpus and test documents will be tokenized, but you will need to convert all tokens to lower case before processing. Only primitive lemmatizing will be required, as described below. The corpus and test document file names will be furnished to the program as command arguments. Your program must input the corpus and test documents, build an HMM based on the corpus, and use it to tag the tokens in the test document. Output must be in the same format as in the provided gold standard output file.

Programming Language: You may use any of the following programming languages: C, C++, Java, or Python. You may not use any high-level library functions for constructing the HMM. It is the specific intent of this assignment that you build the HMM yourself using the basic general purpose programming constructs of your chosen programming language. Any use of unauthorized libraries will result in substantial grade deductions.

Your program must run on the instructor's machine, which contains only standard distributions for gcc, g++, Java 8, and Python 3.6.2. You must not require the instructor to install any additional libraries or extensions in order to run your program.

Command Arguments: Your program must accept two command arguments representing, in order, the names of the training corpus and test document files, so that test scripts can be used to run your program on multiple test sets for evaluation.

It is not necessary for your program to do any validation of either the number of arguments or the presence of the named files. All invocations of your program will be well formed.

Corpus File Format: The corpus file will be a pre-tokenized text file, with one token per line, followed by whitespace and the pre-labeled tag for the token, to be used for training. Sentence boundaries are indicated by empty lines in the file. You must convert all tokens in this file to lower case before training.

We will use a modified version of the CoNLL 2000 test data file for training, which you can find herePreview the document.

Test File Format: The test file will be a pre-tokenized text file, with one sentence (not token) per line. This file will not be pre-labeled. Sentence boundaries are indicated by newlines. You must convert all tokens in this file to lower case before testing.

It is possible that the test file may contain some tokens that were not seen in the training corpus. In this situation, your program should simply tag each such token as NN (common noun). This should allow your Viterbi implementation to proceed with such tokens in the document.

The test file that was used for producing the sample output file may be found herePreview the document.

Lemmatizing the Input: In addition to converting all input tokens (but not POS tags) to lower case, only the following primitive lemmatizing for handling plural word forms is required:

If the lower case word ends with "sses" or "xes", then drop the last 2 characters; Else if it ends with "ses" or "zes", then drop only the last character; Else if it ends with"ches" or "shes", then drop the last 2 characters; Else if it ends with "men", then change the last 2 characters to "an"; Else if it ends with "ies", then drop the last 3 characters and add "y". Output Format: All program output should be to the console and should be in the same format as the complete program output for the sample test document, which may be found here. In particular, the intermediate probability values shown for the Viterbi algorithm should indicate the back pointer direction by identifying the tag at the prior step that is responsible for the current step value.

What to Submit: You must submit your program as a single source file of type .c, .cpp, .java, or .py. Comments at the top of the file should identify this assignment and you as the author. The comments should also provide complete instructions for compilation (if required) and for running your program using command arguments.
